However, most days are relatively unremarkable. You colleagues, family and friends You see yourself. You work, you eat, you try to sleep on time. However, there are building blocks in a project that require you to spend a lot of time in any typical day : You can build your house a little, tear it down a little, or completely ignore it. To choose the first option, start each day by imagining your whole goal and desire to complete it Live up to that desire. Take a brief look at the day in the evening and you may realize where you fell short of your goal.",
